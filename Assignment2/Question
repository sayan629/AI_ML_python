Concept: Inheritance

Concept: Abstraction
Q6. Create an abstract class with an abstract method
calculate_salary().

Concept: Constructor Overloading (with Default Parameters)
Q7. Create a class that allows the constructor to work with:

• name + age + address
As direct constructor overloading (multiple constructors) are not allowed but
we have to use default parameters to simulate constructor overloading.
