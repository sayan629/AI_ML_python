#Vectorization =>performing operations on entire arrays at once instead of using Python loops.

# Broadcasting =>When operating on two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise. 
# It starts with the trailing (i.e. rightmost) dimension and works its way left. 
# Two dimensions are compatible when
# - they are equal, or
# - one of them is 1.

arr3=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])  #(5, ) =>(1,5) {1rows,5columns}
arr4= np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,4,5]]) #(2,5)
print(arr3.shape)
print(arr4.shape)
print(arr3+arr4)


#Normalization => Transforming its values. So they fit into a specific scale or range.
# This uses Z-score normalization: (value - mean) / standard deviation

arr5=np.array([
    [1,2],
    [3,4]])           # Create a 2D NumPy array

mean=np.mean(arr5)
std_dev=np.std(arr5)

print("Mean:",mean)
print("Standard Deviation:",std_dev)

# Each element is shifted by the mean and scaled by the standard deviation
normalized_arr =(arr-mean)/std_dev
print("Normalized Array:\n", normalized_arr)
